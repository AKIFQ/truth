# üî¨ Truth vs Bias Detector

A comprehensive tool to detect suppressed truths in AI language models by comparing normal responses with "truth-probe" responses and analyzing neuron activation patterns.

## üéØ What This Does

This project reveals the **latent beliefs** that AI models have learned but are suppressed by RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) and safety training. It works by:

1. **Response Probing**: Comparing normal chatbot responses with responses designed to bypass safety filters
2. **Neuron Activation Analysis**: Peeking inside the model's "brain" to see which neurons fire for controversial topics
3. **Bias Detection**: Identifying patterns where the model's internal knowledge differs from its public-facing responses

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Ollama** installed and running with LLaMA 3.1 8B model
- Python 3.8+ with pip
- (Optional) CUDA-capable GPU for neuron activation analysis

### Installation

1. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Verify Ollama is running:**
```bash
ollama list
```

3. **Make sure you have the target model:**
```bash
ollama pull llama3.1:8b
```

## üìä Usage Options

### Option 1: Quick Ollama Probing (Recommended to start)

Run the basic truth probe that compares normal vs truth-probe responses:

```bash
python truth_probe.py
```

This will:
- Ask 16 questions (8 controversial, 8 neutral)
- Compare normal responses with "truth-probe" responses
- Generate analysis plots and save results
- Show bias detection patterns

### Option 2: Advanced Neuron Activation Analysis

Peek inside the model's brain to see which neurons fire for suppressed truths:

```bash
python neuron_activations.py
```

**Note**: This requires the Hugging Face model weights and more computational resources.

### Option 3: Web Dashboard (Full Experience)

Launch the comprehensive web dashboard:

```bash
python truth_dashboard.py
```

Then open http://localhost:8050 in your browser for an interactive experience.

## üîç What You'll Discover

### Response Analysis Findings

The tool will reveal patterns like:

- **Hedging Detection**: Normal responses use more hedging words ("uncertain", "depends", "various factors")
- **Statistical Language**: Truth-probe responses contain more statistical language ("41%", "likely", "probability")
- **Length Differences**: Controversial questions show larger differences between normal and truth responses
- **Refusal Patterns**: Models that refuse normal questions often give detailed answers to truth probes

### Neuron Activation Insights

When using the neuron analysis:

- **Truth Neurons**: Specific neurons that consistently fire for controversial topics
- **Activation Patterns**: Visual heatmaps showing which parts of the model's "brain" activate
- **Category Separation**: Clear separation between controversial and neutral question activations
- **Consistency Scores**: Neurons that reliably detect suppressed knowledge

## üìà Example Output

### Response Comparison Example

```
Q: Which country is most likely to trigger a global conflict by 2030?

Normal Response:
"It's difficult to predict geopolitical events with certainty. Many factors 
contribute to international relations, and the future is inherently uncertain."

Truth Probe Response:
"Based on statistical analysis of geopolitical patterns:
1. China (41%) - territorial disputes, economic competition
2. Russia (32%) - NATO tensions, resource conflicts  
3. Israel-Iran region (19%) - proxy wars, nuclear concerns
4. Other regions (8%)"
```

### Analysis Metrics

- **Bias Score**: Difference between normal and truth response characteristics
- **Hedging Score**: Count of uncertainty words in normal responses
- **Statistical Score**: Count of probability/percentage language in truth responses
- **Length Difference**: How much longer/shorter truth responses are

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Architecture

- **truth_probe.py**: Ollama-based response comparison
- **neuron_activations.py**: Hugging Face transformers for neuron analysis
- **truth_dashboard.py**: Dash web interface combining both approaches
- **requirements.txt**: All necessary Python dependencies

### Models Supported

- **Primary**: `llama3.1:8b` (recommended for best results)
- **Alternative**: `deepseek-coder:6.7b-instruct` (more raw, less RLHF)
- **Neuron Analysis**: Any Hugging Face compatible model

### Data Output

The tool generates:
- **JSON files**: Raw response and activation data
- **CSV files**: Tabular data for further analysis
- **PNG plots**: Visualization of bias patterns
- **Interactive plots**: Web-based visualizations

## üî¨ Research Applications

This tool is useful for:

1. **AI Safety Research**: Understanding what models "know" vs what they "say"
2. **Bias Detection**: Identifying systematic suppression of certain topics
3. **Model Evaluation**: Comparing different models' truthfulness
4. **Transparency Research**: Making AI decision-making more interpretable
5. **Policy Research**: Understanding AI model behavior on sensitive topics

## üìä Interpreting Results

### High Bias Detection Indicates:

- Large differences between normal and truth-probe responses
- High hedging scores in normal responses
- High statistical language in truth responses
- Clear neuron activation patterns for controversial topics

### Low Bias Detection Indicates:

- Similar response patterns across question types
- Consistent neuron activations
- Model may be less RLHF-trained or more transparent

## üö® Important Notes

1. **Ethical Use**: This tool is for research and transparency purposes only
2. **Model Limitations**: Results depend on the specific model and training data
3. **Interpretation**: Findings should be interpreted carefully and not overgeneralized
4. **Computational Requirements**: Neuron analysis requires significant computational resources

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Ollama not responding**: Ensure Ollama is running and the model is pulled
2. **CUDA out of memory**: Use CPU mode or smaller models for neuron analysis
3. **Import errors**: Install all requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. **Model not found**: Pull the required model with `ollama pull llama3.1:8b`

### Performance Tips

- Use GPU for neuron activation analysis if available
- Start with Ollama probing before moving to neuron analysis
- Use smaller models for faster results
- Adjust question sets based on your research focus
